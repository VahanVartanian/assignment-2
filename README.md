This is my Sweet Safari website project, a multi-page bakery website built using React.js. It has a Home page, Menu page, Staff page, and Contact page. The site is responsive, so it looks good on different devices, and I used Tailwind CSS to style it. The Menu page has items displayed dynamically using useState, and each menu card animates into view with Framer Motion. The Staff page uses a carousel made with React Slick, the Contact page has some icons for things like the phone and email, which I added using Bootstrap Icons. This project was a bit tricky because I had to use new tools like react slick, framer motion, and other third-party libraries like tailwind but I think I managed to get everything working the way it should. 

How to install:

in the terminal run these commands:

npm install

npm install react-router-dom

npm install framer-motion

npm install react-slick slick-carousel

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

npx tailwindcss init

npm run dev
